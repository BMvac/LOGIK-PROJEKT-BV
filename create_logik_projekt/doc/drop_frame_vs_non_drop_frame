Drop Frame Timecode:
Purpose: Drop frame timecode is commonly used in broadcast networks using NTSC (National Television System Committee) standards. It helps maintain synchronization with real time.
How It Works: Drop frame timecode occasionally skips frame numbers (drops frames) without affecting the visual playback speed. It adjusts for the slight discrepancy between the actual 29.97 frames per second (fps) and the 30 fps ideal.
Counting Method: When the remaining 0.03 seconds of 29.97 fps finally add up to a full video frame, drop frame timecode drops a frame number. It does not remove a frame entirely. Over time, it distributes these dropped frame numbers.
Example: In drop frame timecode, 00:10:00:00 is the same as 10 minutes in real time, and no frame numbers are dropped when the minute is divisible by 10.
Non-Drop Frame Timecode:
Purpose: Non-drop frame timecode consistently increments frame numbers according to the frame rate (e.g., 29.97 fps).
How It Works: Non-drop frame timecode counts every single video frame without re-labeling any frame. It does not adjust for the 29.97 fps discrepancy.
Considerations: If you have a 60-minute film with 0 frames in a non-drop frame timeline, it does not represent the actual running time of the film.
Choosing Between Drop Frame and Non-Drop Frame:
Broadcast Television: For broadcast television, use drop frame timecode.
Other Scenarios: Otherwise, it doesn’t significantly impact the visual content, so you can choose based on editing system specifications, distribution media, or personal preference1.

Drop Frame Timecode (DF):
Format: Drop frame timecode is typically represented with semicolons (;) or periods (.) as dividers between digit pairs. The format is usually HH;MM;SS;FF or HH.MM.SS.FF.
Purpose: Drop frame timecode compensates for video playback at 29.97 frames per second (fps) instead of the ideal 30 fps. It ensures synchronization with real time.
Dropped Frames: Two frames of timecode are dropped every minute, except on the tenth minute, when nothing is dropped. The exact numbering goes: 59:28, 59:29, 1:00:02, 1:00:03… (Notice that frames 1:00:00 and 1:00:01 are skipped)1.
Common Frame Rates Supported:
29.97 fps (NTSC American System, ATSC, PAL-M)
30 fps (ATSC)
Non-Drop Frame Timecode (NDF):
Format: Non-drop frame timecode is displayed with colons separating digit pairs: HH:MM:SS:FF.
Purpose: NDF provides a more accurate representation of video frames without dropping any frames. It’s commonly used in movie production.
Common Frame Rates Supported:
23.976 fps (often used for film)
24 fps (film, ATSC, 2K, 4K, 6K)
25 fps (PAL, SECAM, DVB, ATSC)
59.94 fps (NDF, used for high-definition video)
60 fps (NDF, used for high-definition video)23.

I (Interlaced):
Meaning: The letter “I” refers to interlaced video. Interlaced video displays frames by alternating between odd and even lines (fields) to create a full frame. Each field represents half of the image.
Usage: Interlaced video was common in older television broadcasts and analog formats. For example, 1080i represents 1080 lines of resolution displayed in an interlaced manner.
P (Progressive):
Meaning: The letter “P” stands for progressive video. In progressive video, each frame contains all the lines of the image, providing smoother motion and better quality.
Usage: Progressive video is prevalent in modern digital formats, such as 720p (720 progressive scan) or 1080p (1080 progressive scan).
PsF (Progressive Segmented Frame):
Meaning: PsF combines elements of both interlaced and progressive video. It presents frames as if they were progressive, but each frame is divided into two segments (fields) that are temporally offset.
Usage: PsF is often used in high-definition video production and broadcasting. For example, 1080PsF represents 1080 lines of resolution with a segmented progressive structure.

D (Drop Frame):
Meaning: The letter “D” is associated with drop frame timecode. As we discussed earlier, drop frame timecode adjusts for the discrepancy between the actual 29.97 frames per second (fps) and the ideal 30 fps in NTSC video. It occasionally drops frame numbers to maintain synchronization with real time.
N (Non-Drop Frame):
Meaning: The letter “N” represents non-drop frame timecode. NDF counts every single video frame without dropping any frames. It’s commonly used in film production and other scenarios where precise frame counting matters.
TC (Timecode):
Meaning: The abbreviation “TC” simply stands for timecode. It refers to the numerical representation of time in video or audio formats. Timecode helps synchronize different media elements during editing, playback, and distribution.
LTC (Linear Timecode):
Meaning: LTC is a type of audio timecode. It’s an analog signal recorded on an audio track alongside the video or film. Devices can read LTC to determine the current time position.
VITC (Vertical Interval Timecode):
Meaning: VITC is another type of timecode embedded within the vertical blanking interval of a video signal. It’s often used in professional video equipment.
